\title{Generates a test statistics sample of random projections.}
\usage{
rp.sample(y, k = 1, pars1 = c(100,1), pars2 = c(2,7), seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a numeric vector or an object of the \code{ts} class containing a
stationary time series.}

\item{k}{an integer that determines the `2k` random projections are used for
every type of test. The `pars1` argument generates the first `k` projections,
and `pars2` generates the later `k` projections. By default, \code{k = 1}.}

\item{pars1}{an optional real vector with the shape parameters of the beta
distribution used for the first `k` random projections By default,
\code{pars1 = c(100,1)} where, \code{shape1 = 100} and \code{shape2 = 1}.}

\item{pars2}{an optional real vector with the shape parameters of the beta
distribution used to compute the last `k` random projections. By default,
\code{pars2 = c(2,7)} where, \code{shape1 = 2} and \code{shape2 = 7}.}

\item{seed}{An optional \code{\link[=set.seed]{seed}} to use.}
}
\value{
A list with 2 real value vectors:
 \item{lobato:}{A vector with the Lobato and Velasco's statistics sample.}
 \item{epps:}{A vector with the Epps statistics sample.}
}
\description{
Generates a 2k sample of test statistics  projecting the stationary process
using the random projections procedure.
}
\details{
The \code{rp.sample} function generates `2k` tests statistics by projecting
the time series using `2k` stick breaking processes. First, the function
samples `k` stick breaking processes using \code{pars1} argument. Then, projects
the time series using the sampled stick processes. Later, applies the Epps
statistics to the odd projections and the Lobato and Velascoâ€™s statistics to
the even ones. Analogously, the function performs the three steps using also
\code{pars2} argument

The function uses beta distributions for generating the `2k` random projections.
By default, uses a \code{beta(shape1 = 100,shape = 1)} distribution contained
in \code{pars1} argument to generate the first `k` projections. For the later
`k` projections the functions uses a \code{beta(shape1 = 2,shape = 7)} distribution
contained in \code{pars2} argument.

The test was proposed by \emph{Nieto-Reyes, A.,Cuesta-Albertos, J. & Gamboa, F. (2014)}.
