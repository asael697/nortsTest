## Referee report of "nortsTest: An R Package for Assessing Normality of Stationary Processes".

- **Id**: 2022-186

## General

This paper describes a new R package nortsTest and associated functionality. In a nutshell, the nortsTest package performs several tests to access normality of stationary processes, and provides a function `check_residuals()` to check the estimated residuals from a time series model.

The tool is likely to be of interest to the R community. But it seems that almost all the techniques and methods involved in this work were proposed and developed in other papers published many years ago, as evidenced by the year of the references. So the methods included are not up-to-date.

## Detailed comments

1. As I mentioned, the methods involved in this work were proposed many years ago, the authors should check out the most recent literature to confirm if there is any updates in the methods used for assessing normality of stationary processes. If so, it would be better to include these new test methods in this R package to make it up-to-date. If not, the authors may need to provide additional review and clarification.

2. The paper needs to clarify/highlight its novel contributions and make it more explicit.

3. In this nortsTest R package, the normality tests for stationary processes are only applicable for univariate time series, the authors should clarify this point in the paper. Moreover, is there any normality tests for multivariate time series can be included in this R package?

4. The table of contents of this paper is strange. Firstly, the section and subsection numbering is really confusing. Secondly, each heading is repeated twice, please check and fix it.

5. For the forecast package, the function used to check residuals from a time series model is `checkresiduals()` rather than `check.residuals()`.

6. Writing needs to be more careful. For instance, the sentence "We propose an ETS model." in page 11 is confusing because ETS models were not newly proposed in this work.

## Code

This R package uses a lot of "for loops", which can make the computation very time consuming, especially for long time series. For example, for a time series involving only 3000 observations, the `rp.test()` function is already running very slowly. This needs to be improved.
