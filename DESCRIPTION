Description: This package is for testing normal distribution on stationary time series,
    it performs the Lobato and Velasco's, Epps, Psaradakis and  Vavra, and the random 
    projections tests for stationary univariate time  series, some other diagnostics such as, 
    unit root test for stationarity, seasonal tests for seasonality, and arch effect test for 
    volatility; are also performed. The package also offers residual diagnostic for linear 
    time series model develop in several time series analysis packages.
