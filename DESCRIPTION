Description: Despite that several tests for normality in stationary processes have been proposed
   in the literature, consistent implementations of these tests in programming languages are limited. 
   Four normality test are implemented. The Lobato and Velasco's, Epps, Psaradakis and  Vavra, and the 
   random projections tests for stationary process. Some other diagnostics such as, unit root test for 
   stationarity, seasonal tests for seasonality, and arch effect test for volatility; are also performed. 
   The package also offers residual diagnostic for linear time series models developed in several packages.
