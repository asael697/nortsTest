Description: Despite that several tests for normality in stationary processes have been proposed
   in the literature, consistent implementations of these tests in programming languages are limited. 
   Six normality test are implemented. The exact Lobato and Velasco's, Epps, Psaradakis and  Vavra, 
   Lobato and Velasco's sieve bootstrap approximation, El bouch et al., and the random projections tests 
   for univariate stationary process. Some other diagnostics such as, unit root test for  stationarity, 
   seasonal tests for seasonality, and arch effect test for volatility; are also performed. Additionally,
   the El bouch test performs normality tests for bivariate time series. The package also offers residual
   diagnostic for linear time series models developed in several packages.
