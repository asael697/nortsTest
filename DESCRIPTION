Description: This package is for testing normality of stationary process, it tests if a given 
    data follows a stationary Gaussian process. The package performs the Lobato and Velasco's, 
    Epps, Psaradakis and  Vavra, and the random projections tests for stationary process. Some 
    other diagnostics such as, unit root test for stationarity, seasonal tests for seasonality, 
    and arch effect test for volatility; are also performed. The package also offers residual 
    diagnostic for linear time series models developed in several packages.
